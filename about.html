			<h2>about StarTech Science</h2>
			<!--h3>Why are we waiting for 2 nd generation Breakthrough in Clinical Study Start-Up?</h3-->
			<!--p>
				As a pharma industry faces financial pressures because of ceasing the patent of blockbuster drugs,insufficient drug pipelines, in pharmaceutical companies or among developing/developed drugs, those completions make more intense. Because of the fact, they penetrate into new strategies to enhance their operational efficacies and to lunch developing drugs as fast in clinical trials.
				For instance, they design fast tracker strategic approach to Regulatory Authorities, as if conducting Phase I and II or Phase II and III together. As the monitoring activities’ excellence, they apply a risked-based monitoring strategy or a remote-monitoring concept in clinical trials.
				Yet, Clinical Study Start-Up (SSU), which is one of the inefficient steps in the clinical trials process, is an area to tackle a potential bottleneck. Some companies tried to improve study start-up activities through a centralized SSU management. But, that brand-new ideas were hardly applicable, as there are a variety of languages in the world, and, Specially, Asia Pacific Region’s regulatory process are more complex than the US or EU or other countries.
				As the solution of the current problem in a Clinical Study Start-Up field, we noticed that more localized and flexible approach needs to be developed. Currently many CROs and pharmaceutical companies are conducting SSU trackers and Investigator/Site information in excel spreadsheets or other scattered databases. As project by project the information is updated, it is really difficult to keep previous historical data. Moreover, those affect on delaying preparation of feasibilities/site selections 
				and IRB submission seriously. As can be know, staffs turn-overrate cannot be guaranteed for establishing site activation as fast and stable.In the world-wide, there are happening IT integration and expansion of wearable devices speedy.
				StarTech Science explores our re-invention and adjusts the 2 nd IT evolution with people in clinical trials. Our first brand StarSys Version 1.0 – Clinical Study Start-Up Database is going to lunch on 13 May 2016 internally. Our various and profound Clinical Study Start-Up experience will make better success with IT integrated solutions to contribute to pharmaceutical industries and people.
				<-->
